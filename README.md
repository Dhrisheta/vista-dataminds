# 🎮 Real-Time Pixelation of Obscene Content in Gaming Live Streams

## 📌 Abstract

With the surge in popularity of live game streaming platforms like Twitch, YouTube Live, and Kick, there has been a pressing need to ensure that streaming content remains safe and appropriate for all audiences. Our project, *Real-Time Pixelation of Obscene Content in Gaming Live Streams, focuses on implementing an intelligent system that detects and pixelates explicit or inappropriate content (such as nudity, gore, or objectionable visuals) **in real time*.

By leveraging computer vision and deep learning techniques, the system continuously processes video frames and automatically obscures any detected obscene regions without interrupting the flow of the stream. This helps streamers maintain compliance with platform guidelines and ensures a safer viewing experience for a broader audience.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ *Real-time content moderation* during live streams
- ✅ *Automatic detection* of obscene or NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content
- ✅ *Dynamic pixelation* over objectionable regions
- ✅ Optimized for *low latency and performance*
- ✅ Scalable for integration with major streaming platforms

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- *Python*
- *OpenCV* – For real-time video processing
- *TensorFlow / PyTorch* – For NSFW content detection models
- *MediaPipe / YOLOv8 / Custom CNNs* – For object/region detection
- *FFmpeg / OBS integration* – For stream handling (optional)
- *Flask / FastAPI* – For serving models (optional microservice architecture)

## 🔍 How It Works

1. The video stream is read frame by frame.
2. Each frame is passed through an objectionable content detection model.
3. If explicit regions are detected, those regions are pixelated using OpenCV.
4. The processed frame is then pushed back into the live stream with minimal delay.
